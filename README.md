# homework_1_SB

As I submitted the homework late, I have done in it app format with dart, small navigation part and the functional almost same, 

Flutter app with two tabs:

- **Number → Words:** converts 0..99,999,999 to long-form English (optional hyphenation)
--- Here are added examples for fast checking, but you can also use the bar for typing and validating the code
- **Nested Sum:** editable JSON input; sums using Dart 3 pattern matching
--- Here is added the initial example, but you can add numbers, strings in " or ', arrays and so on for validating the code

## You can just run
flutter pub get
flutter run
